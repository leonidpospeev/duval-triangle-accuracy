This repository contains algorithms to check how the Duval triangle accuracy drops with the increase in a measurement instrument uncertainty.
The algorithms and related general concepts are explained in this article:
https://www.pospeev.com/home/duval-triangle-accuracy

data.csv is a file containing the algorithms results. The first column in the file is a measurement error, second is the rate of the results where the Duval triangle region matched the true and measured values, third is where it mismatched, fourth is a ratio in percents of the matched results divided by the total number of measurements for the given accuracy (100 in this case).
